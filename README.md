# TransitCenter Equity Dashboard

The TransitCenter Equity Dashboard (https://dashboard.transitcenter.org/) tracks how well public transit systems in seven US regions serve their riders, and how changes to transit service affect riders over time. The dashboard measures access to opportunity on transit, transit service intensity and transit affordability for people of color, people living in poverty, essential workers, and other people who rely on transit to meet their daily needs. The dashboard also includes metrics of transit reliability and how travel times to key destinations on transit compare to travel times by car. The dashboard shows these data with a series of charts, interactive maps, and downloadable data sets. Data begin in February 2020 and are included for Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles, New York City, Philadelphia, San Francisco-Oakland, and Washington D.C.

The TransitCenter Equity Pulse was funded by TransitCenter and was completed in May 2021 by Sustainable Systems Research, LLC, SF2 Enterprises Inc, University of Vermont, and Klumpentown Consulting. The project team includes Jeff Allen, Steven Farber, Alex Karner, Willem Klumpenhouwer, Lisa Li, Rick Liu, Mitchell Robinson, Diego Da Silva, Dana Rowangould and Amer Shalaby. The work was performed in collaboration with Mary Buchanan and Steven Higashide at TransitCenter. Community partners in the seven US regions provided feedback and guidance on the dashboard.
